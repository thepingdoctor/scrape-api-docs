# Poetry Setup Complete

This document summarizes the Poetry packaging implementation for the scrape-api-docs project.

## What Was Done

### 1. **Project Structure Reorganization**
Created a modern Python package structure following best practices:
```
scrape-api-docs/
├── pyproject.toml              # Poetry configuration file
├── README.md                   # Updated with Poetry instructions
├── LICENSE                     # MIT license (unchanged)
├── .gitignore                  # Python/Poetry ignore patterns
├── scrape.py                   # Original script (kept for backward compatibility)
├── src/
│   └── scrape_api_docs/        # Main package directory
│       ├── __init__.py         # Package initialization
│       ├── __main__.py         # CLI entry point
│       └── scraper.py          # Core scraping logic (refactored from scrape.py)
└── tests/
    └── __init__.py             # Test package initialization
```

### 2. **Poetry Configuration (pyproject.toml)**
Created a comprehensive Poetry configuration with:
- **Package metadata**: name, version, description, authors, license
- **Dependencies**: requests, beautifulsoup4, markdownify
- **Dev dependencies**: pytest, black, flake8, mypy
- **CLI script**: `scrape-docs` command that runs the scraper
- **Python version**: ^3.8.1 (compatible with all dependencies)
- **Build system**: Poetry Core

### 3. **CLI Command**
The package now provides a `scrape-docs` command that can be used after installation:
```bash
scrape-docs <URL>
```

### 4. **Updated Documentation**
Modified README.md to include:
- Poetry installation instructions
- pip installation alternatives
- Development setup guide
- Building and publishing instructions

## Installation & Usage

### For Users

**Install with Poetry:**
```bash
poetry install
poetry shell
scrape-docs https://example.com/docs
```

**Install with pip:**
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/thepingdoctor/scrape-api-docs.git
scrape-docs https://example.com/docs
```

### For Developers

**Setup development environment:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/thepingdoctor/scrape-api-docs
cd scrape-api-docs
poetry install
poetry shell
```

**Run the tool:**
```bash
poetry run scrape-docs <URL>
```

**Format code:**
```bash
poetry run black src/
```

**Run linting:**
```bash
poetry run flake8 src/
```

**Run type checking:**
```bash
poetry run mypy src/
```

## Publishing to PyPI

When you're ready to publish the package to PyPI:

1. **Build the package:**
   ```bash
   poetry build
   ```
   This creates distribution files in the `dist/` directory.

2. **Publish to PyPI:**
   ```bash
   poetry publish
   ```
   You'll need PyPI credentials. First time users should create a PyPI account at https://pypi.org/

3. **Test with TestPyPI first (recommended):**
   ```bash
   poetry config repositories.testpypi https://test.pypi.org/legacy/
   poetry publish -r testpypi
   ```

## Version Management

To update the version number:
```bash
poetry version patch   # 0.1.0 -> 0.1.1
poetry version minor   # 0.1.0 -> 0.2.0
poetry version major   # 0.1.0 -> 1.0.0
```

Or edit the version directly in `pyproject.toml`.

## Key Features

✅ Modern Python packaging with Poetry
✅ Proper package structure with src layout
✅ CLI command installation (`scrape-docs`)
✅ Development dependencies configured
✅ Code formatting/linting tools ready
✅ Backward compatible (original scrape.py still works)
✅ Ready for PyPI publication

## Next Steps

1. **Test the package thoroughly** with various documentation sites
2. **Add unit tests** in the `tests/` directory
3. **Consider adding more features**:
   - Output format options (JSON, HTML)
   - Rate limiting configuration
   - Concurrent downloads
   - Progress bars
4. **Publish to PyPI** when ready
5. **Set up CI/CD** with GitHub Actions for automated testing

## Notes

- The original `scrape.py` file is still present for backward compatibility
- Poetry created a virtual environment automatically
- All dependencies are locked in `poetry.lock` for reproducibility
- The `.gitignore` file excludes `poetry.lock` - you may want to commit it for reproducible builds
